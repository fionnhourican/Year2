-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cd (change directory) command: 
        - This command is used to change the current working directory. If an argument is provided, it changes the          directory to the specified path. If no argument is provided, it prints the current working directory.

clr (clear) command: 
        - This command is used to clear the terminal window.

dir (directory) command:
        - This command is used to list the contents of the current directory or a specified directory. If a directory is provided as an argument, it lists the contents of that directory. Otherwise, it lists the contents of the current directory.

function_environ command:
        - This command is used to list the environment variables.

echo command:
        - This command is used to print the arguments passed to it to the standard output.

help command:
        - This command is used to display the user manual (readme file) using the more filter.

pause command:
        - This command is used to pause the shell and wait for the user to press the enter key.

quit command:
        - This command is used to exit the shell program.

I/O Redirection:
    I/O redirection is a mechanism in which the input and output of a program are redirected from the default sources and destinations to other sources and destinations, respectively. It is a useful technique for controlling and manipulating input and output in various programming and operating system contexts.

    According to Silberschatz et al. (2018), I/O redirection is accomplished in UNIX systems by using special characters to redirect input and output. The "<" character is used to redirect input from a file, and the ">" character is used to redirect output to a file. Alternatively, the ">>" character can be used to append output to a file instead of overwriting it. These characters are used in conjunction with other shell commands and constructs to perform various I/O redirection tasks.

    Similarly, Robbins et al. (2005) state that I/O redirection is an essential feature of shell scripting that enables scripts to be more flexible and powerful. It allows scripts to read input from files or other sources, and to write output to files or other destinations. In addition, I/O redirection can be used to filter and transform data using various command-line tools and utilities.

    Overall, I/O redirection is a fundamental concept in programming and operating system design, and is used extensively in various contexts. It allows for greater control and flexibility over input and output, and enables powerful scripting and automation tasks.



Program Environment:
        Program environment refers to the set of variables and values that define the state of a program during its execution. This includes environment variables, command-line arguments, and the working directory of the program. The program environment is important because it can affect the behavior of a program and its output.

Background Program Execution:
        Background program execution allows users to run a command in the background while continuing to use the shell for other tasks. It is achieved by appending an ampersand at the end of the command line or using the nohup command.

        This allows users to perform multiple tasks simultaneously in the shell. According to Hu and Johnson (2018), background processes are executed by appending an ampersand '&' at the end of the command line. This enables the user to continue working in the shell while the background process runs concurrently.

Batch File:
        A batch file is a script or sequence of commands that can be executed in sequence by the operating system without user intervention. It is commonly used in Windows operating systems for automation tasks or for running a series of commands at once. Batch files can be created using any text editor and saved with the .bat extension.
